# Cybersecurity Homelab Client Machines: Windows Server, Windows 10, Kali Linux, and Metasploitable 2 Setup

## Overview

In this, I am going to setup the following client machines and servers in my Homelab:
- **Windows Server 2019**: Configured as a domain controller with **Active Directory**.
- **Windows 10 Client**: Joined to the domain to simulate a corporate environment.
- **Kali Linux**: Used for penetration testing and vulnerability scanning i.e to perform different attacks on windows machine and metasploitable machine.
- **Metasploitable 2**: A vulnerable target machine used for performing attacks and exploiting its vulnerabilities.

## Step 1: Set Up the Windows Server 2019 (Active Directory Domain Controller)

### 1.1 Install Windows Server on VMware

1. **Download Windows Server ISO** from Microsoft's official site.
   ![](../images/ISO_images_and_OVA files.png)
2. **Create a new VM** in VMware with at least:
   - **2GB RAM**, **2 CPU cores**, **40GB disk** (Mininmum requirement for the windows 2019 server vm).
   - Attach the Windows Server ISO and complete the installation as like of opnsense.
   - **Note**: Use windows server standard eddition as it require less resources and choose datacentre edition if your have large enterprise requirement.

3. Set an **Administrator password** and log into the Windows Server.
![](../images/windows_server_installation_5.png)
4. Remove the ISO from the booting device and set to directly boot from Hard disk.
![](../images/windows_server_installation_6.png)

### 1.2 Configure Active Directory

1. **Assign a Static IP along with subnet mask,default gateway and dns server** (In my case I use, `ip =192.168.11.240 `, subnet mask= 255.255.255.0, gateway= 192.168.11.2 and dns server =192.168.11.240).

   ![](../images/windows_server_dns_configuration.png)
2. **Install Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)** via **Server Manager > Add role and features**.
![](../images/server_manager.png)
![](../images/ADDS_installation_1.png)
![](../images/ADDS_installation_2.png)
3. **Promote the server to a domain controller**:
   - Set up a new root domain (In my case I use, `uttam.local`).

     ![](../images/promote_to_DC_1.png)

     ![](../images/promote_to_DC_4.png)
     ![](../images/promote_to_DC_5.png)

4. Now Restart the server and open **Server Manager> Tools> Active Directory Users and Computers** to verify that AD is running.

## Step 2: Set Up Windows 10 Client VM

The Windows 10 client will be joined to the domain controlled by the Windows Server.

### 2.1 Install Windows 10 on VMWare

1. **Download Windows 10 OVA file** from Microsoft's website.
![](../images/ISO_images_and_OVA_files.png)
2. From **OVA package** you had a Pre-configured VM which can be imported directly and ready to use without running the intaller.
**Alternative : from ISO image**
1. **Download Windows 10 ISO file** from Microsoft's website.
2. **Create a new VM** in VMware with:
   - **1.5GB RAM**, **1 CPU core**, **40GB disk**.
![](../images/windows_configuation.png)
3. Complete the installation with a local account similar to earlier ISO installation and start the machine.
![](../images/windows_10.png)
4. **Check network coniguration**
![](../images/windows_network_configuration.png)

### 2.2 Join the Windows 10 Client to the Domain

1. Set the **DNS server** of the Windows 10 VM to the IP of the Windows Server (In my case, `192.168.11.240`).
![](../images/set_dns_of_DC.png)
2. Go to **System > About** and click **Advance Settings**.
3. Enter the **domain name** (In my case, `uttam.local`), and provide **Administrator credentials or any user crudential that is present on the DC** to join the domain.
![](../images/join_the_domain.png)
![](../images/join_the_domain_2.png)
5. Restart the VM and log in with **domain credentials**.

## Step 3: Set Up Kali Linux for Penetration Testing

**Kali Linux** will be used for penetration testing(attacking machine) in my homelab. It will be used to test attacks against both the **Windows Server, windows 10 client** and **Metasploitable 2**.

### 3.1 Install Kali Linux on VM
- You can install kali from the **ISO** or through a pre-configured **OVA** file(Similar installation steps).
- Both **ISO** and **OVA** files are available at kali linux official website.
- Once installed, update the system by running following command in terminal:
  ```bash
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
  ```
  ![](../images/kali_linux.png)
## 3.2 Configure Kali Networking

### Configure the Network:

1. Set **Kali Linux** to use the same **internal network (vmnet 2)** as the other VMs in the homelab (LAN network of OPNsense).
 ![](../images/kali_linux_configuration.png)
2. The default gateway is set to the **LAN ip of opnsense**.(In my case it is 192.168.1.100)
 ![](../images/kali_network_configuration.png)
### Verify Connectivity:

Check if the **Kali Linux VM** can communicate with the other VMs in your network:
```bash
ping 192.168.11.240   # Ping Windows Server
ping 192.168.1.102    # Ping Windows 10 Client
ping 192.168.1.103    # Ping Metasploitable 2
ping google.com       # Ping to internet 
```

## Step 4: Set Up Metasploitable 2 (Vulnerable Target Machine)

**Metasploitable 2** is a deliberately vulnerable Linux machine designed to be used for practicing penetration testing.

### 4.1 Install Metasploitable 2

1. **Download Metasploitable 2** from official website: [https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/).

2. **Import the VM into VMware**:
   - Open VMware and select **Import Appliance**.
   - Import the **Metasploitable 2 OVA** file.

3. **Start the VM** and log in with default crudential **user-> msfadmin and password-> msfadmin**.

### 4.2 Configure Networking for Metasploitable 2

1. Set the **network adapter** of Metasploitable 2 to the same internal network (vmnet 2) as the other VMs.
 ![](../images/metasploitable_configuration.png)
### Verify Connectivity:

Ensure that **Metasploitable 2** can be pinged from **Kali Linux** and other VMs.
